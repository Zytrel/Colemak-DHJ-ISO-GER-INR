# Colemak-DHJ-ISO-GER-INR
My personal modification of Colemak-DH to better accomodate the German language and ISO-QWERTZ keyboards.

Modifications:
- Add direct access to German umlauts via AltGr
- Swap the 'J' and ';/:' keys
- Invert the number row shift state
- Rearange special (AltGr) keys to match the German QUERTZ-layout
